## 1000 - 1199
 - Bruteforce/search
 - Number theory - divisors, factorization, floor, ceil, modulo
 - Time Complexity
 - Two pointers
 - Binary/bitwise (rare)
 - Dynamic Programming

Goal: solve A, B quickly or A-c (div. 2) or A-D (div. 3)

## 1200 - 1399
 - Number theory - gcd/lcm, prime factor representation
 - Binary Search
 - Two pointers
 - Basic Combinatorics
 - Basic range queries (e.g. prefix sums)
 - Recursion
 - Dynamic Programming

Goal: solve A-C somewhat quickly (div. 2) or A-E (div. 3)

## 1400 - 1599
 - Binary Search, two pointers
 - Basic Combinatorics
 - Basic range queries (e.g. prefix sums)
 - Recursion and Dynamic Programming
 - Basic graphs/trees
 - Constructive

Goal: solve A-C quickly and consistently (div. 2)

## 1600 - 1899

 - Dynamic Programming
 - Basic graphs/trees (topo sort, traversals, MST, shortest paths)
 - Basic combinatorics (inclusion/exclusion)
 - Bitwise
 - Segment trees
 - Constructive

Goal: solve A-D consistently, speed is a plus (div. 2)
 

## 1900 - 2099
Goal: solve A-D quickly and consistently A-E (div. 2) or A-B (div. 1)

## 2100 - 2399
Goal: solve A-B very fast, A-C consistently (div. 1)
